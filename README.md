# Undergrad-EDA

This repository contains all my work (3 homework and 1 final project) in my undergraduate study course -- Exploratory Data Analysis. In this class, I use R language.

## Homework 1
The [dataset]() contains 1436 records of second-hand cars features and sales information. The purpose of this homework is to predict the sale price of second-hand car based on its objective features.

[final report (in Chinese)](https://github.com/chenxi36871/Undergrad-EDA/blob/5e3788fd04cafc5080cb09cbb5a4e2d836cf8517/hw1/2018110760%E6%9D%8E%E6%99%A8%E8%8C%9C.pdf)


## Homework 2
The [dataset](https://github.com/chenxi36871/Undergrad-EDA/blob/5e3788fd04cafc5080cb09cbb5a4e2d836cf8517/hw2/germancredit.csv) contains information of 1000 loan applications (characteristics and results(approved or not)). The description of the variables is [here](https://github.com/chenxi36871/Undergrad-EDA/blob/5e3788fd04cafc5080cb09cbb5a4e2d836cf8517/hw2/germancreditDescription.docx). The purpose of this homework is to train a logistic regression model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not.
Split the whole dataset to 900 for training data and 100 for test data.

## Homework 3
The dataset contains nutrition information of 77 different cereal.
(1) Please do some exploratory analysis on given data. Use PCA to generate comprehensive features to show the nutrition of cereal.
(2) Based on the comprehensive features we got from question (1), group cereals by manufacture and try to find what's in common and what's different.
